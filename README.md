MyReads is a book-tracking application built as a graduation project from Udacity React development cross skilling Program.

- The main page shows three shelves for books. Each book is shown on the correct shelf, along with its title and all of its authors.
- The main page shows a control that allows users to move books between shelves.
- When the browser is refreshed, the same information is displayed on the page.
- The search page has a search input field, as the user types into the search field, books that match the query are displayed on the page.
- Search results on the search page allow the user to select “Currently Reading”, “Want to Read”, or “Read” to place the book in a certain shelf.
